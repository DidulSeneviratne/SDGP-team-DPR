To do this:

Stand with your feet about hip-width apart.
Bring your arms behind you and interlace your fingers with your palms pressing together. Grasp a towel if your hands donâ€™t reach each other.
Keep your head, neck, and spine in one line as you gaze straight ahead.
Inhale as you lift your chest toward the ceiling and bring your hands toward the floor.
Breathe deeply as you hold this pose for 5 breaths.
Release and relax for a few breaths.
Repeat at least 10 times.
