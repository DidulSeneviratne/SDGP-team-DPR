To do this:

Stand with your big toes touching and your heels slightly apart.
Bring your hands to your hips and fold forward at your hips.
Release your hands toward the floor or place them on a block. Don’t worry if your hands don’t touch the ground — just go as far as you can.
Bend your knees slightly, soften your hips joints, and allow your spine to lengthen.
Tuck your chin into your chest and allow your head to fall heavy to the floor.
Remain in this pose for up to 1 minute.
