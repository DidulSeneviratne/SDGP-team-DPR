To do this:

Stand with your feet about hip-width apart with a slight bend in your knees.
Extend your hands in front of you or place them on your thighs.
Lengthen your neck, bring your chin toward your chest, and round your spine.
Then look up, lift your chest, and move your spine in the opposite direction.
Hold each position for 5 breaths at a time.
Continue this movement for a few minutes.
