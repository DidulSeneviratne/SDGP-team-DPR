Sitting at a desk or table

Sit with your back straight and shoulders back.
Keep your feet flat on the floor. Do not cross your legs or ankles.
Rest your forearms on the table while keeping your shoulders back.
Your chin should be parallel to the floor, and your ears should align with your collar bone.
