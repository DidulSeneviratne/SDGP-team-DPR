To do this:

Come onto your hands and knees with your weight balanced evenly between all four points.
Inhale to look up, dropping your abdomen down toward the ground as you extend your spine.
Exhale and arch your spine toward the ceiling and tuck your chin into your chest.
Continue this movement for at least 1 minute.
