To do this:

Sit on your shinbones with your knees together, your big toes touching, and your heels splayed out to the side.
Fold forward at your hips and walk your hands out in front of you.
Sink your hips back down toward your feet. If your thighs wonâ€™t go all the way down, place a pillow or folded blanket under them for support.
Gently place your forehead on the floor or turn your head to one side.
Keep your arms extended or rest them along your body.
Breathe deeply into the back of your rib cage and waist.
Relax in this pose for up to 5 minutes while continuing to breathe deeply.
